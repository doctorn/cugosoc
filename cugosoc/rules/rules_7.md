##Further Rules
 And those are (essentially) the whole rules of go. There are just two more rules that are needed to cover cover special cases - the ko rule which stops the game repeating and the seki rule which deals with local stalemate situations. I will tell about those next week and hope that they don't occur in any of the games you play this week. They are rather rare. If they do come up I hope that there will be a stronger player on hand to explain them to you.

I should also mention the handicapping system. When players of different abilities play, the stronger one can give the weaker one a handicap. This means that on his first move black places several stones on the board at once in a predetermined arrangement. Play then continues normally with white making the next move. For example, if I were to play one of you on a 9x9 board I would probably have to give you a 4 stone handicap. That means that on your first move you would put 4 stones onto the 4 marked points like this:
