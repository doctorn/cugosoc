2. On completion of your move, your Clock time is incremented  by the Bonus time.
3. If your Clock time reaches zero before you press your clock, you lose.

## Travel
### Bus
The venue is less than ½ mile west of the bus station. Walk to John Lewis in St Andrews Street and then Downing street to Mill Lane.

### Train
The venue is about 1¼ mile north-west of the Cambridge rail station. You may catch any one of several buses from the station going towards the city (see the map below).

### Car
The nearest car park is the Grand Arcade, but it is probably best to use Park & Ride.

## Refreshments and Lunch
### Refreshments
The University Social Club will be providing light refreshments during the tournament.

### Lunch
The venue is very near to the University Centre (where Trigantius used to be hosted some years back), and there is a good restaurant in the Centre. The local pub is The Mill, situated just outside the venue on the bank of the river Cam.
